## The Dataset is an Imbalanced Two-Class Classification Problem. 

The predefined models I selected while working with R to find the right model didn't perform very well.

After a pretty hefty coding with the 'tidymodels' library, I tried to run the model with Azure Machine Learning Designer Resource. Using the AutoML Feature, the **MaxAbsScaler, LightGBM** (Weighted AUC = 0.98750) showed as the best fit for this data.

Happy Machine Learning!!
